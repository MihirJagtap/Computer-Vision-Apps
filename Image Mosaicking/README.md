I have manually clicked 3 photos to be blended so 
that a panaroma can be made. As the images were taken by hand, I tried to
go as Professor had instructed about clicking panaromas. 

Input image names: chair1.png, chair2.png, chair3.png
Output image names: chair_panaroma.png

the chair1.png is the left most image, chair2.png is the center image and 
the chair3.png is the right most image.

The images were taken by hand, sometimes my hand might have been shaking, 
still the images are as expected.
